For my final project at TripleTen, I had the freedom to choose the analysis type and BI tool. I opted for Tableau, focusing on restaurant analysis.

### Data
The data was an archive with 5 Excel spreadsheets file provided by TripleTen:
The archive with the test data given by your Team Lead. Weâ€™ll find 5 tables there:
- `'food'`: Contains information about food items.
- `'menu'`: Provides details about restaurant menus.
- `'orders'`: Includes data on customer orders.
- `'restaurant'`: Contains information about restaurants.
- `'users'`: Provides details about registered users.
  
  After look at the date, I choose to use just `'restaurant'` and `'orders'` and INNER JOIN them by id = R id


### Description:
- 10 page Tableau Visulization and Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and stories as a report format
- Through this initiative, our goal is to communicate stakeholders with actionable insights, facilitating informed decision-making to enhance restaurant performance and revenue generation.

### Assumptions:
- Restaurants with higher ratings receive more orders and generate higher revenue.
- Fine dining establishments generate higher revenue
- Restaurant Analysis is based on the Indian market

### Process:
1- Choose what type of analysis I was going to use for the Zomato Dataset

2- Created a Decomposition Plan to start figuring out what type of questions I wanted to answer with the data

2- Look up and analyze all the tables and choose which ones I was going to use for my Restaurant analysis 

3- INNER joined sheets.

4- Then I analyzed data and use my decomposition plan to start creating visualizations to determine what factors conduct my restaurant analysis 

5- I built 3 different  dashboards to determine what was causing popularity in restaurants

6 - Lastly I created Tableau story to present my findings and recommendations.

7- Put the presentation in PDF format 

### Findings:
1- Dominos Pizza: Leads in revenue among restaurants.

2- Indian and North Indian Cuisine: Popular due to geographical factors.

3- Review Count and Sales: Higher review count correlates with more sales and higher foot traffic.

4- Volume vs. Ratings: Despite high ratings, restaurants with fewer reviews may generate more revenue due to local business volume.

5 - Revenue Trends: January and summer months exhibit the highest revenue trends.

6 - Higher Ratings, Higher Revenue: Restaurants with better ratings tend to generate more revenue.

7- American Franchise Influence: Half of the top 10 revenue restaurants are American franchises, reflecting the adoption of American culture in India.

### Recommendations:
- '`Promote Local Cuisine'`: Leverage the popularity of Indian and North Indian food by highlighting authentic regional dishes. Collaborate with local chefs to create unique and memorable dining experiences.

- `'Engage with Customers'`: Encourage more reviews and engagement. Offer loyalty programs, discounts, or incentives for leaving reviews. Positive reviews drive sales, so actively seek feedback from satisfied customers.

- '`Local Business Focus'`: Recognize that volume matters. Even restaurants with fewer ratings can generate substantial revenue if they cater to local clientele. Support small businesses and promote their offerings.

- '`Seasonal Marketing'`: Capitalize on January and summer trends. Create seasonal promotions, themed menus, and outdoor events. Highlight refreshing summer drinks and light dishes during hot months.

- '`Quality over Quantity'`: Prioritize quality ratings. Higher-rated restaurants tend to attract repeat customers and positive word-of-mouth. Invest in exceptional service, ambiance, and food quality.

 - '`Franchise Opportunities'`: Explore American franchise partnerships. Their popularity indicates market acceptance. Consider adapting successful franchise models to local preferences.
