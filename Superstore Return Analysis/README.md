### Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item
### Description:
- 10 -page Tableau Visualization and Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and stories
- Purpose was to prepare an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders

### Assumptions:
- Percentage of returns are affecting overall performance of products, missing out potential increase in revenue.
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- Operations department will need to make changes.

### Process:
- I first joined sheets and then Ensured proper LEFT JOIN with Returns and Orders tables.
- Build worksheets for different return rate views.
- Create low-fidelity mock-ups and choose a design.
- Develop a template using empty containers.
- Add worksheets to the dashboard template.
- Finalize dashboards with markers and titles.
- Craft a presentation story arc with captions.
- Include a summary, root causes, and dashboard insights.
- Deliver a brief Tableau presentation.

### Findings:
- Increased sales correlate with higher returns.
- Technology category has the highest return rate.
- California, Oregon, and Idaho consistently lead in product returns.
- Superstore shows consistent annual order growth.
- Technology and Office Supplies are top profit categories.
- August has the highest return rate, possibly due to back-to-school shopping; September and December also see increased returns during peak retail periods.
